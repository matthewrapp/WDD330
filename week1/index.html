                    <li>Something talked about in the Mobile UX/UI videos that having navigation in the bottom. I see that often with mobile applications, but is it really the best, most effectient way to display a menu on mobile web?</li>
                    <li>When doing some searching around the internet, specifically social media, I noticed that Instagram's desktop website is exactly like the mobile application. Normally, I think most people would say that's okay, but I think it's not very good looking and not as easy to navigate through the website when comparing to other social media outlets. Is that something done on purpose? What could be the reasoning for that?</li>
                    <li>I really like what Steve Jobs had to say about knowing more about your user than the user knows about themselves. What are some practices, questions, actions we could ask/take to get to that position so most the most user-friendly, beautiful mobile designs?</li>
