            <h4>Lesson 1, Step 1: How to Rewire Your Brain for Mobile First UX</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>"If you design for the smallest, least powerful device first, then you will focus on the content, and your core functionality. That leads to simple beatiful apps. If you do it the other way around, it'll be like trying to put a marshmello into a piggy bank, which is neither simple, nor beatiful." - Joel Marsh</li>
                <li>We need to rewire our brains in order to adapt to the new tech that is changing and changing fast.</li>
                <li>When Steve Jobs announced the iPhone, mobile usage started to rise really fast as desktop usage started to decline.</li>
                <li>Desktop computers/laptops are replaced every 4-5 years. Mobile and tablets are replaces every 2 years.</li>
                <li>There is a paradigm shift. There use to be maybe like 1-2 electronic devices/computers lying around the house. Now, on average, there is 2-3 devices per person in a household. All having a smart phone, while some having a tablet as well, laptop, and maybe there still being a desktop computer somewhere.</li>
                <li>"The simple guideline is whatever you are doing, do mobile first." - Eric Schmidt from Google</li>
                <li>Why is it a problem to create desktop first and still making it responsive?</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Just because your website is responsive, it doesn't mean it's movile first. Taking what you already have and making it work on mobile is called "Responsive Retrofitting."</li>
                    <li>Responsive Retrofitting is cheaper, it is faster than a "ground-up re-write," but it doesn't change other issues. Other issues being:</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The screen real estate issue</li>
                        <li>The touch interaction issue</li>
                    </ul>
                </ul>
                <li>What are the downsides to doing a full, mobile redesign?</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Time consuming</li>
                    <li>Costly</li>
                </ul>
                <li>We need to REWIRE our brains. Things to remember about rewiring our brains:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Desktop computer sales have been declining since 2011</li>
                    <li>You don't see people with their heads in laptops.</li>
                    <li>Start small and scale up.</li>
                    <li>Most important: Mobile is NOT a fad.</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>

        <!-- Lesson 1, Step 2 Notes -->
        <div class="container_90 notes_container">
            <h4>Lesson 1, Step 2: How to Improve UX by Understaind Users</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>"It's really hard to design products by focus groups. A lot of times, people don't know what they want until you show it to them." - Steve Jobs</li>
                <li>Don't listen to what users wants, observe what they are doing.</li>
                <li>Three things you can do to get to know the user better than they know themselves:</li>
                <ol>
                    <li>Be there.</li>
                    <li>Be Useful.</li>
                    <li>Be Quick. Reduce their cognitive load.</li>
                </ol>
                <li>Don't make the user go through more steps than needed.</li>
                <li>Reachability Matters, how the users handle their device. For example:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>75% of people rely on their thumbs when using handheld device.</li>
                    <li>49% use a 1 handed grip.</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Speed matters! How does it effect business?</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>With Google, 1/2 second delay = 20% drop in traffic.</li>
                    <li>With Bing, 2 second delay = 4% drop in revenue.</li>
                    <li>With Aol, they found that the fast 10% of their users, stay 50% longer.</li>
                </ul>
                <li>How can we ensure that things are loading quickly for users?</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Reduce image usage</li>
                    <li>SVG/Webfonts are lower bandwidth</li>
                    <li>Omptimize and minify CSS and JS files</li>
                    <li>GZIP files to eliminate unnecessary data</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="container_90 notes_container">
            <h4>Lesson 1, Step 3: Better Mobile UX with Strategic Menu Design</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>"The trouble with software is... it sucks. That's not a a nice thing to say... but it is a fundamental truth. Software customers -- you, me, CIOs of multibillion-dollar companies...have learned to live with mediocre software. We do not count on software to be intuitively easy to understand of to work consistently. Instead, we make do." - Stewart Alsop</li>
                <li>What can we do to make things better for everyone?</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Keep it simple and fluid.</li>
                    <li>Placement matters of primary controls. Where should the menu button go? etc.</li>
                    <li>Keep up to date on latest trends. Mobile is evolving quickly.</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>

        <!-- Lesson 1, Step 4 Notes -->
        <div class="container_90 notes_container">
            <h4>Lesson 1, Step 4: Designing Intuitive and Mobile Friendly Forms</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>"The constaints of Mobile push you toward more focused, simplified solutions. You can only fit so much on the screen, people often have to wait for it, and they're unlikely to give you their full attention. So make it easy to understand and use and focus on the important things first. Mobile is a great forcing function for simplicity." - Luke Wroblewski</li>
                <li>A big issue these days is the amount of information on a form required for the user. Do you need all the information? Think about what information do you NEED, and add nothing else.</li>
                <li>Float labels on forms is really good.</li>
                <li>Big checkboxes so you can hit it with a thumb with no issue.</li>
                <li>For forms with a lot of information needed, try using pagination. Also, if you do use a pagination, consider using a progress bar so the user doesn't have a clue how long this will take.</li>
                <li>Passwords matter!</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Especially on mobile, users do not like entering in passwords. Ways to fix this?</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Consider not making the passwords by default. Give them an option to mask the password if they want, though.</li>
                        <li>Face recognition, if possible.</li>
                    </ul>
                </ul>
                <li>If you are asking for something that is only numbers, don't bring up the standard keyboard. Bring up the number pad! Way easier for the user to input the numbers right.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

            <h4>Lesson 1, Step 5: Designing a Better Mobile Advertising User Experience</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>"End-users, not technologies, shape the market. Consequently marketers need to stay abreast not only of technological developments but also of the way people respond to them." - Matt Haig</li>
                <li>What can we do to make mobile ads nice?</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Make them small and simple. Once clicked on, then the ad can expand to be bigger, but start them off smaller.</li>
                    <li>Stop using pop-ups and pop-overs.</li>
                    <li>Users don't visit your website to look at ads.</li>
                    <li>Keep it simple and sleek.</li>
                    <li>Make sure it unobtrusive. Content should come first.</li>
